The code in this directory is from https://github.com/mattdesl/color-wander
regressionbuddy uses this code to generate random 404 images.

git may have a way to reference this repository as a submodule but i just copied the code and removed the .git directory and the .gitignore file so git would add the files to the regressionbuddy repository.
