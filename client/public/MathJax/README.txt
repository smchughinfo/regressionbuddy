The code in this directory is from https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax
regressionbuddy uses this code to generate random 404 images.

git may have a way to reference this repository as a submodule but i just copied the code, checked out version 2.7.2 (git checkout 2.7.2), and removed the .git directory and the .gitignore file so git would add the files to the regressionbuddy repository.
