        I need to take a break. This site is a lot of work and I need the time right now.
        Since the site is always one post ahead the next live post won't be until
        <span style="text-decoration:line-through">6/3/2018</span>
        <span style="text-decoration:line-through">6/17/2018</span>
        7/1/2018 (you can still access the old posts<a href="/3">here</a>).
        If you are interested, <a href="https://steganographyjr.com">this</a> is the project that's causing the delay.
        It's with a heavy heart that this keeps getting pushed off but I am looking forward to getting started again. This is not an abandoned project.

        In the meantime, here's a little game.

            *Note - The game uses the concept of polynomial curve fitting which is covered in Linear Algebra, Post 4 (currently in <a href="/4/appendix/linear-algebra/review">review</a>).
            Check it out. It's not that hard. The key to understanding it is the coeffeceints of the polynomial are the components of the solution of the system.
