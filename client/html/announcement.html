        I need to take a break. This site is a lot of work and I need the time right now.
        Since the site is always one post ahead the next live post won't be until 6/3/2018 (you can still access the old posts <a href="/3">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, here's a little game.

            *Note - The game uses the concept of polynomial curve fitting which is covered in Linear Algebra, Post 4 (currently in <a href="/4/appendix/linear-algebra/review">review</a>).
            Check it out. It's not that hard. The key to understanding it is the coeffeceints of the polynomial are the components of the solution of the system.
