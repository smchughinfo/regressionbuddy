            <h4>About</h4> 
            <p>This site is for anyone that knows the math and wants some practice problems to stay sharp. This site is not intended to teach math, it's just for practice. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/7fgvs6/do_you_think_anyone_would_be_interested_in_a/" target="_blank">Reddit loved the idea</a> so I made it. New problems are published every Sunday morning. Enjoy!</p>

            <h4>LaTeX</h4>
            <p><a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>, the comment system used on this site, does not support LaTeX. They do support images so you could use an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=online+latex+editor" target="_blank">online latex editor</a>, take a screenshot, crop it, and upload that.</p>
